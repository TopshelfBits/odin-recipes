    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Double pie crust <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-pie-crust">(recipe)</a>
            </li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 1/4 lbs Granny Smith apples (peeled, cored)</li>
            <li>8 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the pie crust of your choice. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-pie-crust">(recipe)</a> Preheat oven to 425˚F.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium. Whisk 3 Tbsp flour then simmer for 1 minute. Whisk constantly, adding in 1/4 cup water, 1 cup sugar and boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Peel and remove cores. Thinly slice ~7 cups of apples. Place apples into a bowl and sprinkle the top with 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Toss to combine, and pour the sauce from Step 2. Stir to coat the apples well. </li>
            <li>Sprinkle where you will roll out bottom pie crust with flour. Make the pie crust to a 12" diameter. Wrap around a rolling pin to transfer to a 9" pie plate. Add the mixture, with most of it in the center. (Careful not to fill the edges - which would make it difficult to seal)</li>
            <li>Bake at 425˚F in the center of oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350˚F and bake for another 45 minutes or until the apples soften. Rest for 1 hour at room temp before enjoying. </li>
        </ol>
