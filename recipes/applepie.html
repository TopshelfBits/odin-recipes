<h1>Fable - Erudite Apple Pie</h1>
    <p>The food widely available in Albion is known for providing more than a wonderful taste. Most foods can restore your health back to normal. Some can also provide other benefits, like extra Strength or Skill experience. There are plenty of foods to chose from.. however, as with most things in life, some are rarer than others. When it comes to desserts, the apple pie is a classic. Humanity's first disobedience: Definitely the best one.</p>
