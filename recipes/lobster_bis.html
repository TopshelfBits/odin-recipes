    <h3 class="inverse_star">Description</h3>
    <p>The <em>Stardew Valley</em> lobster bisque is a special dish, and unless you are close friends with Willy, it's quite difficult to get your hands on this secret recipe. Today I will be sharing this meal with all of you on behalf of Willy's permission. A <strong>delicious</strong> soup involving just a few ingredients!</p>
    <h3 class="star_title">Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 lobster</li>
        <li>1 milk (or large milk)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 closes garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="inverse_star">Step by Step</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Use a large pot to fill with water half-way. Bring to a boil over high heat. As it begins boiling, add lobers for 8-10 minutes (or until shells are bright red). Save the water for your lobster base when finished.</li>
        <li>Cut through the shell with shears, or chop in half to pull out the flesh. Remove any veins, chopping into bite-size pieces. Throw the shells back into the water, and boil for another 10 minutes. After boiling, strain the water, saving 1 1/2 cups of the base.</li>
        <li>Heal olive oil in a sauce pan with medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add paprika, tomato paste and lobster base. Stir to combine well. Simmer while uncovered for ~10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Blend the mixture until very smooth in a separate blender. Return the mix back into the pan, and add the milk and lobster meat. Taste test, while adding your salt and pepper as needed. Heat through. </li>
